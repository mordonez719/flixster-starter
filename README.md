### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs were useful whenever I ran into a bug and needed guidance. Reading through the instructions and reviewing the lab resources were very helpful in finding a place to start. More in-depth lessons on useStates and passing props between components might have been helpful when implementing the more technical features for the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have liked to implement the stretch features and fix any hidden bugs that I could not find.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

For my project demo, I was able to show the different tabs of my website, which differed from some of my peers that kept all the features on the main page. However, at the time of my demo, my styling was not complete and my css features fell short. Additionally, one of my peers was able to save favorited and watched movies after refreshes and re-renders, which I would have liked to try.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Boris, Sammy, and Emmanuel were very helpful when getting my API working and fixing many errors!
